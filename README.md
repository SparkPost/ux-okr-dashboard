### UX Team OKR Dashboard

A hacky dashboard that parses through 2web2ui to measure design system efficiency.

```bash
# To run this dashboard:
# First clone 2web2ui in a sibling to this one

# Install dependencies
npm i 

# Source data, will take a minute
npm run source:all

# Run Gatsby, which will open via localhost:8002
npm run start
```
